# Behavioral Cloning Implementation in Keras
**Project Overview:** With in this projet the objective to drive a car aunomostly around a track using a deep neural network. The netural network is trained to predict the suitable steering angles based on the images that are available from the three cameras in fornt of the car. The training data set is collected by driving the car manually around the track and recording the images from the cameras as the input feature and the steering angles as the labels. The outline of the project is:

**1.Data collection and Visualization**

**2.Data Augmentation**

**3.Normalization and Pre-processing**

**4.Deep Netural Network Artchitercture**

**5. Neural Network Training**
