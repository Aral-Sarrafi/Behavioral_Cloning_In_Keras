# Behavioral Cloning Implementation in Keras
**Project Overview:** With in this projet the objective to drive a car aunomostly around a track using a deep neural network. The netural network is trained to predict the suitable steering angles based on the images that are available from the three cameras in fornt of the car. The training data set is collected by driving the car manually around the track and recording the images from the cameras as the input feature and the steering angles as the labels. The outline of the project is:

* Data collection and Visualization**
* Data Augmentation**
* Normalization and Pre-processing**
* Deep Netural Network Artchitercture**
* Neural Network Training**

# 1. Data Collection and Visualization
Probably the most important part of this project which is playing a major role in the performance of the trained model is the data collection. In fact the trained deep neural network will learn and clone the driving pattern of the driver from the collected data. Therefore, if the quality of the data is not good the network will not be able to navigate the car sucessfully around the track.
